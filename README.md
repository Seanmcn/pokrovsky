#Pokrovsky

##Github History Vandalism as a Service

_v0.0.1_

##Introduction

The unbroken chain of pointless Things-as-a-Service continues. This one uses my [Uncle Clive](http://uncleclive.herokuapp.com) service to generate a script suitable for vandalising your Git commit history ([my account](http://github.com/pikesley) is probably displaying an example right now).

###API

####/:githublogin/:repo/:text

Will return a bash script which, when run locally, will:

* initialise a local git repo named _:repo_
* create a series of empty commits
* push the repo to **git@github.com:_:githublogin/:repo_.git**

The commits will be structured such that they will 'write' the _:text_ on the Github commit calendar using the 1982 Sinclair Spectrum character set. There is a limitation in that the Spectrum font is 8 units high, and the Github calendar has a height of 7 (see [http://uncleclive.herokuapp.com/#textpokrovsky](http://uncleclive.herokuapp.com/#textpokrovsky) for an explanation of how this is handled).

All of the above assumes that you can do public-key authentication to Github from the box on which you're running this.

###Usage example

Create a new, disposable Github repo, then try this:

    DISPOSABLEREPO=dummy
    GRAFFITI=`echo "Â© 1982" | sed "s: :%20:g"`
    GITHUBUSER=`git config --get user.name`
    curl "http://pokrovsky.herokuapp.com/${GITHUBUSER}/${DISPOSABLEREPO}/${GRAFFITI}" | bash

###Notes

* You should start with a fresh repo each time, both locally and on Github. The script makes no attempt to create a new Github repo, and it certainly doesn't try to delete anything from there. If you can't work out how to do this safely, you probably shouldn't use this service.
* The calendar is 52 weeks wide. Spectrum characters are 8 units wide. So, you know, 6-character strings.
* If you decide this isn't for you after all, just delete the repo and it will all go away.
* This owes a _massive_ debt to [Gelstudios'](https://github.com/gelstudios) splendid [Gitfiti](https://github.com/gelstudios/gitfiti).
